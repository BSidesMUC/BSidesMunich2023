Originally from the hilly Sauerland Ingmar was drawn by the big mountains (and of a job offer) to munich almost 15 years ago.
After starting in systems and network administration Ingmar fell into the rabbit hole of security and annoyed clients with his findings as a penetration test and red teamer. 
His spare time his spent around the alps, on motorcycles, bikes or on foot.
