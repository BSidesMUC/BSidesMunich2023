Suffering from persistent earworms, Jenn works as an earthling cyber security and privacy governance manager by day.
Her nights and weekends are littered with jogging, 3d printing, video-editing, music-making, hiking, AI exploring and TV-binging.
She prefers to undertake difficult tasks with epic background music and perpetually seeks early-evening karaoke and jeans made for short-legged tall people.
