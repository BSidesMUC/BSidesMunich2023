In this context here, Tobias would describe himself as an infosec enthusiast. 
He's into ethical hacking, CTFs, cryptography - and related in person meetups - and currently works in roles as a cybersecurity architect. 
If there's any time left besides all of this, his family and the cause for animal & human rights, he'd prefer to spend it running, sailing or in a sauna.
