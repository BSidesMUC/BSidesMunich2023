- bio: "Revered web congregation, hear ye!\r\nHear ye! \r\nWe bring tidings of a truly
    divine keynote by none other than the cyber-high-priest himself, Dr. Mario Heiderich.\r\n\r\nThis
    gallant guardian of the Gateway, this cyber-savant of the Server, this JavaScript
    Jonah, is here to share his sermons from the virtual pulpit.\r\n\r\nYet, fear
    not, dear congregation, for despite his epic battles in the sacred crypts of XSS,
    Dr. Heiderich possesses the humor of a well-timed 404 error and the wit sharper
    than a two-edged encryption key. \r\nHis homilies are as entertaining as a cat
    video, yet as enlightening as the shining light of your screen at 2 a.m."

In this early morning sermon, our dear Reverend will shed light on
ancient truths about sin and virtue, and take those present on a
refreshingly content-free journey from the ancient and glorious past to
the present, the age of glitz and glitter, cloud and no more Twitter,
drawing lines between dots that might better have been left undrawn.
