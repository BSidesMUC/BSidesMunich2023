- bio: "Felix Fischer is a Principal Data Scientist at Gen/Avast and PhD candidate
    at the Chair of Cyber Trust.\r\n\r\nHe studies the interaction of people with
    information security and privacy technologies. This means analyzing their application,
    usability and acceptance in the wild. His most recent publications focus on software
    engineers struggling with getting cryptography right and explore machine learning
    as a tool for usable security and privacy.\r\n\r\nIn his current projects, he
    investigates how machine learning can assist people in protecting their privacy.
    His goal is to develop systems that learn how to process data in a way that achieves
    both, increased utility and privacy for the individual user."

title: The Effectiveness of Security Interventions on GitHub
track: 1
---

Since 2017, GitHub has emerged as a pioneering open-source platform by introducing security warnings and additional interventions to aid developers in bolstering the security of their open-source software.
This talk presents the first quantitative investigation and comparison of the effects of these interventions.

Our comprehensive analysis reveals that all of GitHub's security interventions have a significant positive impact on code security.
Through a meticulous examination of each intervention's design, we identify the successful building blocks and areas for improvement.

Furthermore, our study offers practical recommendations to practitioners for enhancing the design of their interventions, aiming to augment their overall effectiveness in promoting code security.
