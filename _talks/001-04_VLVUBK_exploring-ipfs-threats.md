Even if Web3 usage is still tiny compared with the Web 2.0, that has not stopped bad actors from misusing some of its technology stack.
Without the clear client-server architecture we are used to, the peer-to-peer nature of the storage layer of Web3 is able to fly under the radar and prevent normal methods of content filtering.
We will dive into IPFS as a technology to understand the idiosyncrasies of it and the ways in which it can be abused.
Along the way, we have statistics that document the mounting dangers we have identified and finally discuss how we can mitigate these.
