During a recent incident response engagement, I was assigned to reverse engineer the RAT that the threat actor had deployed in the environment.
When analyzing the malware to unpack it, a suspicious string was found in the memory - and ip number with a list.txt .
The list contained a not only a complete inventory that the threat actor had, but also a link to the full repository of all their tools, almost 5 GB / over 100 files and scripts of content covering every part for an intrusion -from reconnaissance to impact and everything in between.
This led to an interesting labyrinth of research on all the aspects of this tooling.
