- bio: "I’m a passionate and seasoned security professional with over 17 years of
    experience in the industry across a variety of security domains and disciplines.\r\n\r\nMy
    career started as a cryptographer at NASA working on the secure messaging system
    used by the International Space Station. During a focused and driven career, I’ve
    had the opportunity to work across a multitude of different industries and roles
    ranging from security architecture to offensive security to DevSecOps and everything
    in between.\r\n\r\nMy most recent endeavors have been focused on helping others
    improve their ability to rapidly detect breaches and generally bolster their overall
    security posture with simple and pragmatic means and methods. \r\n\r\nI embrace
    any opportunity to teach fundamental security concepts to those who need help
    but have no idea where to look, and I pride myself on being able to break down
    and articulate complex topics in a fun, interesting, and engaging manner that
    appeals to people from all backgrounds."

Breaches continue happening at unprecedented levels with huge financial impact to the global economy year after year.

Our traditional approach to breach detection that is focused on triaging alerts generated by massive amounts of data from disparate sources is not working.
Adversaries know this fact and regularly benefit from it.

The average breach goes unnoticed for 212 days.
That’s an ample amount of time for anyone to surreptitiously run off with the crown jewels and inflict significant damage with ramifications that include consumer privacy violations, loss of trust, steep financial penalties, and irreversible reputational damage.

We need a new approach if we’re ever going to stop the madness.
Hackers also deserve a better opponent.

This talk discusses a different way of thinking about breach detection that is intended to reduce the number of false positives, improve alert fidelity, reduce time-to-detection, and prevent the massive level of burnout affecting our industry.

We will cover the history of breach detection, the current state of affairs, the paradigm shift to new ways of thinking about the problem, and many practical examples of how to deploy effective breach detection technology.
