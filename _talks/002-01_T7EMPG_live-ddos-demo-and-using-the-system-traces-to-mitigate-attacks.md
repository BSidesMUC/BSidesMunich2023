title: Live DDoS Demo and Using the System Traces to Mitigate Attacks
track: 2
---

This session intends to demonstrate 2 of the mostly used DDoS techniques - SYN Flood and Slowloris, using virtual machines as target and attacker simulations.
After the demonstrations are done, the system traces will be investigated live to define the anatomy of each attack and following these logs to develop mitigation strategies.
