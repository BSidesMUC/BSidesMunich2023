In the last few years, many organizations have suffered from ransomware attacks.
Recovering from a ransomware attack usually requires backups, but in some cases there are other ways.
In this session, Alexander will showcase his team's latest research in ransomware decryption capabilities.
The research breaks an entire family of ransomware variants and allows victims to restore encrypted data without obtaining the private keys.
