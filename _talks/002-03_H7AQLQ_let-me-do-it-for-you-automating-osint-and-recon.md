In the areas of offensive and defensive security, valuable information and insights derived from OSINT and reconnaissance are the backbone of success.
But gathering the needed data is not easy, it demands immense effort.
In this talk I want to share some insights on how you can develop capabilities to automate a lot of the work involved in data collection.
With the power of automation, you'll free up valuable time for in-depth intelligence analysis.
