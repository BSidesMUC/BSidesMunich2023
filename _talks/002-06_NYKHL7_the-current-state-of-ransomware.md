Ransomware is the most present threat in Cyber Security today, making the headlines almost every week.
This talk will give an overview of the current ransomware landscape.
We will look at the history, recent developments and give an preview of what might come.
To round up the talk, I will share some (sad and funny) stories from Incident Response in over 80 Ransomware Cases over nearly 10 years solved by Corporate Trust, as well as practical measures for everyone to take home and secure in your infrastructure(s).
