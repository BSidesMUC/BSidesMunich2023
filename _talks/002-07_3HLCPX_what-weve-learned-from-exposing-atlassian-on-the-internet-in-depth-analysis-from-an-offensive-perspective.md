During a recent security assessment of Storebrand's modern environment hosted on Azure, the offensive team identified several attack vectors from the Internet that could compromise the organization's assets.
Specifically, vulnerabilities were discovered in Atlassian products exposed on the Internet, which could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the Web Application Firewall (WAF) was re-evaluated and reconfigured to protect Atlassian products.
Overall, the offensive team's identification of these attack vectors and recommendation to implement a WAF helped Storebrand's security team improve their security posture and better protect their modern environment.
