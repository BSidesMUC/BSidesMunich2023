title: OSINT - Detecting facts and fakes
track: 1
---

This workshop addresses the (critical) challenge of discerning accurate information from misinformation and fake news in the vast digital landscape.
Therefore it will provide an overview and hands-on experience in modern OSINT tools and demonstrate their practical application in real-life scenarios.
To achieve this, a real life example will be conducted where the dissemination of misinformation had significant implications on both journalism and IT security.
