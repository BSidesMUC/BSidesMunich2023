title: OSINT - Detecting facts and fakes
track: 1
---

The proposal addresses the (critical) challenge of discerning accurate information from misinformation and fake news in the vast digital landscape.
An essential aspect of this proposal is to provide an overview and hands-on experience in modern OSINT tools and demonstrate their practical application in real-life scenarios.
To achieve this, we will conduct a real life example where the dissemination of misinformation had significant implications on both journalism and IT security.
