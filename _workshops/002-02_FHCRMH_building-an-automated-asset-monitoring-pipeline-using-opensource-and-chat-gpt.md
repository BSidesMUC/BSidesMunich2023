title: Building an Automated Asset Monitoring Pipeline using Opensource and Chat GPT
track: 2
---

The "Building an Automated Asset Monitoring Pipeline using Open Source and Chat GPT" workshop is a technical training session that combines open-source tools and Chat GPT to create a powerful and automated reconnaissance pipeline.
Participants learn to set up and utilize a comprehensive pipeline that includes subdomain enumeration, HTTP scanning, port scanning, result analysis, and reporting.
The workshop focuses on the technical aspects of using tools like amass, oneforall, httpx, ffuf, naabu or rustscan, anew, notify, nuclei, and Chat GPT to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of asset monitoring.
Participants gain hands-on experience and practical skills in configuring and automating the pipeline, ensuring continuous monitoring and timely identification of vulnerabilities.
By the end of the workshop, participants are equipped with the knowledge and tools to establish an automated asset monitoring pipeline, leveraging open-source technologies and Chat GPT's capabilities to enhance their cybersecurity practices.
