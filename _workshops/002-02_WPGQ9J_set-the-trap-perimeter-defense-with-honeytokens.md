title: Set The Trap! Perimeter Defense with Honeytokens
track: 2
---

It can take months after a malicious attacker gains access to your system to even know they were there.
Next comes months of painful work, analyzing logs, changing credentials, notifying customers, reviewing source code,  and we havenâ€™t even talked about the cost of the breach itself.
So how can you know when an attacker has infiltrated your systems and bypassed your security? Honey tokens are a great way to know when an attacker has breached your systems.
Honeytokens are credentials that don't actually grant any access but instead trigger alerts that report the intruder's activity.

 When attackers gain access to a system, they immediately look for ways to gain more control.
One of the easiest ways to expand their presence is to find plaintext credentials lying around in code, config files, or logs, this makes Honey Tokens the perfect trap.
In this workshop, we will walk through exactly how to create real Honey Tokens you can put in your own infrastructure to trip attackers in their stride using open-source tools and your own cloud infrastructure.

If you are working to detect and stop intruders in their tracks, then this session is for you.
