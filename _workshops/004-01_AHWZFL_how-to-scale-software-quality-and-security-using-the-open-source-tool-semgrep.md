title: How to scale software quality and security using the open source tool Semgrep
track: 4
---

The software security industry is shifting left.
Traditional security tools have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams as they often are too slow, overwhelm users with false positives, and do not provide sufficient remediation help.
As a result, they do not ultimately raise a companyâ€™s security bar.

In this workshop we will focus on hands-on exercises, supported by research results to teach participants how to use Semgrep by taking a different approach to security, called paved road or secure defaults.
