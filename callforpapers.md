BSides Munich is a venue for security professionals, software engineers, students, researchers and visionaries.
We're targeting local communities in and around Munich, but everyone from all the corners of the world is welcome.
The conference gathers the security community in an event to share and discuss novel ideas, initiatives and advancements.

## Rookie Speakers
If you are interested in speaking at an infosec conference about a topic that is dear to you, but you are new or shy, here is your chance! Just add a short "rookie" note in your CFP submission, and we will gladly help you along the way.

The infosec community is full of smart people.
But, public speaking does not come easy for all of us.  So, we are here to encourage and support those who have doubts or a hard time deciding whether or not to go for it.
BSidesMunich 2020 will have two different stages: a main stage and a rookie stage
On the rookie stage you will have a smaller, supportive audience!
If you have something you want to talk about, submit it; even if you are not sure it will be a good enough fit for the conference.

## Submission
The program committee will review your submission based on a descriptive abstract of your intended presentation. 
Feel free to link to preliminary version of your presentation if available, or any other supporting materials. 
Keep in mind: the better your description is, the better our review will be.

## Program committee
Your submission is subject to approval by the program committee of BSides Munich.
